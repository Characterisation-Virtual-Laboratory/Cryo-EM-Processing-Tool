   Hari is running some software called Warp in a Windows machine.
   Switching between the Windows and M3 is making the workflow messy.

Actions:
   Jay: Can Warp be run on M3 ?
     http://www.warpem.com
     Warp has been written in C#. After reading the website, the WARP backend could thoeretically be compiled on Linux,
     however the front end is not supported due to Windows C++ library dependencies.
