Where: Jay's Desk and Hari's lab.
Who: Lance, Hari, Jay

Details:
   The main fields used to vary Motioncor2 runs are:
       PixelSize, Patches, BFactor, Voltage, GainFile, GPU
   Hide the other fields on a tab so they are still accessable.


   Hari is running some software called Warp in a Windows machine.
   Switching between the Windows and M3 is making the workflow messy.

Actions:
   Jay: Can Warp be run on M3 ?
     http://www.warpem.com
     Warp has been written in C#. After reading the website, the WARP backend could thoeretically be compiled on Linux,
     however the front end is not supported due to Windows C++ library dependencies.

   Jay: continue working on the notebook.

12-11-2018
Where: eResearch Breakout Room 39
Who: Hari, Jay

Details: Discussed workflow mode. Jay asked Hari to test the functionality.
	 Jay showed Hari the Ctf Review functionality which displays the ctf micrographs.

	To improve this functionality, The native call to Gctf will be replaced with a
  call to the Relion wrapped version: "relion_run_ctffind".It uses gctf 1.06, we
  should be using that version too, as 1.18 is different. The wrapped version
  supports "other options" to support gctf options not on the Relion screens.

	I will probably need to also alter Motion Corr to use the Relion wrapped
  version of gctf as it produces an output .star file used as input to the Relion
  wrapped version of gctf.

	The reason to use the Relion wrapped ctf, is that it creates an output .star file.
	I can use this .star file to build input to the 'Ctf Review. It contains ctf
  values that can be used for sorting purposes. This will save me from needing
  to write the code to create the .star file.

	The 'Ctf review' screen should contain the following fields 'Defocus U,
  Defocus V, Defocus Angle, Voltage, Spherical Aberration, Amplitude Contrast,
  Magnification, Detector Pixel Size, Ctf Figure of Merit.

	For each of these fields include a 'from' and 'to' field to allow filtering.
  A 'Filter' button will then trigger which ctf micrographs will be displayed
  to the user.

	A Plot of 'number of mrcs vs Ctf Max Resolution' will allow Hari to visually
   monitor data quality.

	When displaying the ctf micrographs, show two buttons for each:
		- 'Details' which will show all the values
		- 'Original' which will display the input micrograph.

  Add a button the trigger the 'workflow' every 5 minutes.
